When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	So you can access the repository on a different computer/device
  	So other people can contribute to your repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You only want to push or pull changes that are completed and not in a "working progress" state

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Frok - when you want to clone a repository on gitHub creating an automatic reference to de parent
	Clone - when you want to clone a repositoy on your harddrive without a reference to parent
	Branche - when you want to create a new feature, without messing up the master branche
